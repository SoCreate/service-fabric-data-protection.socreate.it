<h1>Setup the Data Protection Store</h1>
<section markdown>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong> Use within a Service Fabric Cluster
  </blockquote>

  First, create a new .NET Core Stateful Service.

  Next, since Data Protection uses the 
  <a href="http://service-fabric-distributed-cache.socreate.it">Service Fabric Distributed Cache</a>
  Store to persist its keys, you'll need to install the Nuget package:

  ```
  dotnet add package SoCreate.Extensions.Caching.ServiceFabric
  ```

  Extend the new stateful service using "DistributedCacheStoreService" as the base class.
