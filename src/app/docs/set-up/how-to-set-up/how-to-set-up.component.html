<h1>Setup the Data Protection Store</h1>
<section markdown>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong> Use within a Service Fabric Cluster
  </blockquote>

  First, create a new .NET Core Stateful Service.

  Data Protection uses the Service Fabric Distributed Cache Store to persist its keys. So next install Nuget package:

  ```
  dotnet add package SoCreate.Extensions.Caching.ServiceFabric
  ```

  Extend the new stateful service using "DistributedCacheStoreService" as the base class.
